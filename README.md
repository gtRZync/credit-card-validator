# Credit Card Validator (C++)

This is a C++ implementation of a credit card validator using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Luhn's algorithm.

## Features

- Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm.
- Implements the solution using OOP concepts like classes, methods, and encapsulation.

## Luhn Algorithm

The Luhn algorithm is used to validate various identification numbers, especially credit card numbers. It works by performing a checksum to determine whether the card number is valid or not.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gtRZync/credit-card-validator.git
```

### 2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd credit-card-validator
```

### 3. Build and run the program:

```bash
make run
```

> This will automatically compile the source files and run the program.
> Make sure you have `make` and `g++` installed on your system or modify the makefile to use your desired compiler.

---

## Usage

1. Input a credit card number when prompted.
2. The program will output whether the card number is valid or invalid based on the Luhn algorithm.

## Example

```
Enter credit card number: 4532015112830366
Credit card number is valid!
```
